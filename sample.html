    <span class="style2">We have many activities for you to choose from, both on site and within the area. Many of our visitors local fishing trips. We have a small fleet of boats that will take you out for either a half-day or a full day. You can also fish in the surf. Beware though, of Ralph. Ralph is our resident blue heron. He knows what you fishermen have in your coolers and if you aren't careful, he'll take your catch off your hands and make a quick get away.<img src="img/f.jpg" >    
  We can also arrange the dolphin cruises. We have a unique approach-two boats go out side-by-side about 50 yards apart. The dolphins love it because it generates a huge wake. You'll see them jumping right between the boats.
  You can arrange for the tickets for fishing excursions and dolphin cruises at the Club House desk.
